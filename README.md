**Note:** I highly recommend anyone looking at this project to consider the [modern, rewritten in Rust, Karttapullatin](https://github.com/karttapullautin/karttapullautin). It is fast and has prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux and Windows (including both arm64 and amd64 architectures for all platforms).

# About
This repo is mainly to host a GitHub workflow that uses [PAR::Packer](https://metacpan.org/pod/PAR::Packer) to pack the original Perl version of [Karttapullautin](http://www.routegadget.net/karttapullautin/) into a standalone executable for macOS or Linux.
