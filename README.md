**Note:** I highly recommend anyone looking at this project to consider the [modern, rewritten in Rust, Karttapullatin](https://github.com/karttapullautin/karttapullautin). It is fast and has prebuilt binaries for macOS (arm64), Linux (arm64/amd64) and Windows (amd64).

# About
This repo is mainly to host a GitHub workflow that uses [PAR::Packer](https://metacpan.org/pod/PAR::Packer) to pack  [Karttapullautin](http://www.routegadget.net/karttapullautin/) into a standalone executable for macOS or Linux.
